[00:15.17] Old yellow bricks
[00:16.98] Love's a risk
[00:19.01] Quite the little escapologist
[00:22.37] Looked so miffed
[00:24.00] When you wished
[00:25.95] For a thousand places better than this
[00:44.95] 
[00:29.44] You are the fugitive
[00:31.35] But you don't know what you're runnin' from
[00:33.57] You can't kid us
[00:35.27] And you couldn't trick anyone
[00:37.14] Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from
[01:06.14] 
[00:43.77] Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
[00:47.57] Blinded by nostalgia
[00:50.68] Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
[01:16.18] 
[00:57.73] She was enraged by the way
[01:01.43] That the emperor put traps in the cage
[01:04.88] And the days she being dull
[01:08.46] Lead to nights readin' beer bottles
[01:25.96] 
[01:12.02] You're such a fugitive
[01:13.97] But you don't know what you're runnin' from
[01:16.02] You can't kid us
[01:17.76] And you couldn't trick anyone
[01:19.70] Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from
[01:48.70] 
[01:26.27] Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
[01:30.23] Blinded by nostalgia
[01:33.46] Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
[01:57.96] 
[02:05.56] You're at a loss
[02:07.01] Just, because
[02:09.09] It wasn't all that you thought it was
[02:12.33] You are a fugitive but you don't know what you're runnin' away from
[02:45.83] 
[02:19.02] She said I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
[02:23.37] And revel in nostalgia
[02:25.83] I know I said who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up, but
[02:32.33] Dorothy was right though
